"""Live capability and pricing lookup for OpenRouter models.

LiteLLM decides which optional params a provider accepts, and what a call cost,
by consulting the bundled model-cost map. For OpenRouter that map is wrong by
construction: OpenRouter publishes new slugs continuously, the bundled map lags
behind, and it answers for neither question on a slug it has not caught up to.
Two distinct silent failures follow from the one root cause:

* **Parameters.** ``litellm.supports_reasoning`` answers ``False`` for an
  unmapped slug, and ``OpenrouterConfig.get_supported_openai_params`` uses that
  answer as a bare gate, so the failure is closed: a ``reasoning_effort`` set
  on a current model is discarded before the request body is built, with no
  exception and (before the ``drop_params`` warning) no log line.
* **Pricing.** ``_get_model_info_helper`` raises "This model isn't mapped yet"
  for an unmapped slug, so ``response_cost`` is never computed and every cost
  consumer downstream of it reports nothing. For a proxy routing current
  OpenRouter slugs this is not an edge case: it is every call.

OpenRouter publishes the authoritative answer to both itself. ``GET
/api/v1/models`` returns every model with a ``supported_parameters`` list and a
``pricing`` block, and requires no API key. This module reads that once, caches
it for the life of the process, and hands callers either the parameter-name set
(``get_supported_parameters``) or a LiteLLM-shaped model-cost entry
(``get_model_cost_entry``) for a given slug.

Two deliberate limits on the pricing half, both about not trading a known
unknown for a confident wrong number:

* **Cost fields only.** The entry carries the rate card, ``litellm_provider``
  and ``mode`` — not context lengths, not ``supports_*`` flags. Registering a
  model's capabilities through this door would change behaviour well beyond
  cost: ``supports_reasoning: true`` alone would make
  ``get_supported_openai_params`` admit ``thinking``, which is a different wire
  shape from OpenRouter's ``reasoning`` and would be forwarded verbatim to a
  provider that does not accept it. ``get_supported_parameters`` remains the
  only path by which a parameter becomes admissible here, and the caller in
  ``OpenrouterConfig`` admits exactly ``reasoning_effort``.
* **Tiered rate cards are declined outright.** OpenRouter expresses a
  long-context surcharge as ``pricing.overrides`` — a list keyed by arbitrary
  ``min_prompt_tokens`` (32000 and 128000 on qwen3-max, for instance). LiteLLM
  has slots for three fixed thresholds and drops the rest, so a faithful
  translation does not exist in general. Registering the base tier anyway would
  under-report by 2-2.5x on exactly the long-prompt turns that make up agent
  traffic, and it would do so silently, under a field name an operator would
  reasonably use to pick a model. So a model with any override is left
  unpriced, its ``cost_estimated`` stays null, and the reason is logged once.
  The provider-reported ``usage.cost`` that ``ChunkProcessor.calculate_usage``
  carries through is the number to read for those models, and it is exact.

Design constraints, because this sits behind a hot, synchronous code path:

* **Fail soft.** Any error, timeout, non-200, or malformed payload returns
  ``None``, and every caller is expected to fall back to the existing
  ``supports_reasoning`` behaviour. This module can make param handling more
  accurate; it must never make a request fail.
* **Fetch at most once per TTL**, including after a failure. A negative cache
  entry keeps an offline or firewalled deployment from attempting a network
  call on every single request.
* **One fetch, not N**, and never a queue. A lock serialises refreshes so
  concurrent requests do not stampede the endpoint; a thread that finds the
  lock held serves the stale cache rather than waiting behind a network call.
* **Importable without litellm.** ``verbose_logger`` is imported inside
  ``_log`` rather than at module scope. This file is maintained as a twin of
  ``config/litellm/openrouter_capabilities.py`` in jwbron/egg, which is unit
  tested in a tree where litellm is not installed. The two are kept
  line-for-line comparable — they differ only in formatting width (this repo
  wraps at 120, that one at 100) and in the couple of docstring references
  that name the other project — so a sync is a copy and a reformat rather than
  a merge. Divergence beyond that is drift, and has bitten before.

Operator knobs (all optional):

* ``LITELLM_OPENROUTER_CAPABILITY_FETCH=0`` disables the lookup entirely and
  restores the previous model-map-only behaviour — parameters and pricing
  both, since one fetch serves both.
* ``LITELLM_OPENROUTER_PRICING=0`` disables only the pricing half, leaving the
  parameter lookup running. For an operator who wants LiteLLM's bundled map to
  be the sole authority on cost while keeping the parameter lookup.
* ``LITELLM_OPENROUTER_CAPABILITY_TTL`` seconds between refreshes
  (default 3600). ``0`` disables caching and re-fetches on every lookup —
  a debugging aid, not a production setting.
* ``LITELLM_OPENROUTER_CAPABILITY_TIMEOUT`` per-phase HTTP timeout in seconds
  (default 5).

An unparseable, unrecognized or out-of-range value for any of these is logged
and ignored rather than silently swallowed: an operator reaching for these vars
is very likely already debugging something. That covers a near miss on the
boolean too — ``FETCH=disabled`` is neither a recognised on nor off spelling, so
it warns and takes the default instead of being read as the opposite of what was
meant.

    None means "no opinion", exactly as in ``get_supported_parameters``, and the
    caller must fall back to whatever it did before — which for
    ``_get_model_info_helper`` is the stock "This model isn't mapped yet"
    ValueError. There are four ways to get it: the lookup is off, the pricing
    half specifically is off, the slug is unknown, or its rate card is tiered
    and therefore untranslatable (see the module docstring; that case is warned
    about once per slug, because unlike the others it is a model we *can* see
    and still will not price).

    ``custom_llm_provider`` is accepted and checked rather than ignored: this
    module speaks only for OpenRouter, and the call site sits on a generic
    lookup that every provider reaches. Answering there for, say, a Bedrock slug
    that happens to share a name would attach OpenRouter's rate card to someone
    else's bill. None is permitted because the caller resolves the provider from
    the model string, and a bare ``qwen/qwen3-max`` legitimately arrives
    unattributed.

    The returned dict is a copy: the cache is process-wide, and LiteLLM's
    model-info path is free to mutate what it is handed.

    Note on freshness: LiteLLM memoizes ``_get_model_info_helper`` behind an
    ``lru_cache``, so the FIRST successful answer for a slug is what the
    process uses until it restarts — this module's TTL governs how often the
    roster is re-read, not how often a priced model is re-priced. That is the
    same staleness every entry in the bundled map already has, and rates move
    on a scale where it does not matter; the provider-billed ``cost`` is
    unaffected either way. ``lru_cache`` does not memoize exceptions, so a
    lookup that failed while the roster was unreachable is retried rather than
    latched.
